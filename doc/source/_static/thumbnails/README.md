# Thumbnails

This directory contains thumbnails for the documentation. They are used in the
documentation to provide a visual representation of the various PyAnsys libraries
and tools.

## Resizing

All thumbnails should be 640x480 pixels. This is the size that the documentation
expects and is resized to this size if it is not already. Resize takes place
through the execution of the ``resize.py`` script in this same folder.

It is necessary to have the ``Pillow`` library installed to run the script. If
you do not have it installed, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```
