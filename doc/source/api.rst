API reference
=============

The ``pyansys`` metapackage on its own does not have a specific API. The only information specific-only
to this package that can be provided is its version. This can be looked up as follows:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from pyansys import __version__
    >>> __version__

    '2023.1.0'

However, each of the PyAnsys packages that shape the ``pyansys`` metapackage have their own specific API
reference section. In order to navigate through them, please refer to their documentation.
