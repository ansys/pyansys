Welcome to the first newsletter article of the PyAnsys ecosystem. In this
article, the new landing page of the project is presented together with the
latest updates on its documentation.

A new landing page
==================

Over the last months, the PyAnsys Core Team has been working on enhancing the
landing page of the project. The new landing page contains the following
elements:

- A hero section containing key links
- A carousel presenting different projects in a dynamic way
- A section listing the latest articles on this blog
- A testimonials section


Other updates
=============

The landing page is not the only section that has been enhanced. The top
navigation bar contains now four main sections:

-  :ref:`Home <ref_index>`: for quickly accessing the main page of the project
-  :ref:`Getting started <ref_getting-started>`: for quick access to installation instructions and tutorials
-  :ref:`Projects <ref_projects>`: for quickly finding the projects that fit your needs
-  :ref:`Blog <ref_blog>`: containing articles and news about the ecosystem
