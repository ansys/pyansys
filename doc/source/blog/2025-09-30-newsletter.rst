   :title: PyAnsys landing page update
   :description: The PyAnsys landing page has been redesigned for improved
                 usability, navigation, and accessibility, based on community
                 feedback and collaboration.

Welcome to the first newsletter article of the PyAnsys ecosystem. In this
article, the new landing page of the project is presented together with the
latest updates on its documentation.

A new landing page
==================

Over the last months, the PyAnsys Core Team has been working on enhancing the
landing page of the project. The new landing page contains the following
elements:

- A hero section containing key links
- A carousel presenting different projects in a dynamic way
- A section listing the latest articles on this blog
- A testimonials section


Other updates
=============

The landing page is not the only section that has been enhanced. The top
navigation bar contains now four main sections:

-  `Home <../index>`_, for quickly accessing the main page of the project
- `Getting started <../getting-started>`_,
- `Projects <../projects>`_, for quickly finding the projects that fit your needs
- `Blog <../blog>`_, containing articles and news about the ecosystem
