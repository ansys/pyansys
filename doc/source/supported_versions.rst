Python versions
===============

The PyAnsys ecosystem follows `SPEC-0`_ for Python version support,
which is also similar to `NEP 29`_. This means:

* PyAnsys packages are expected to drop support for Python versions **3 years** after their
  initial release.

You can find below the timeline for the end of support for each Python version according to the SPEC-0 policy
as well as a table showing the Python versions supported by each PyAnsys metapackage, which might slightly
differ from the SPEC-0 policy but is always aligned with it.

* Grayed out Python versions are no longer supported by the current version of the PyAnsys metapackage.
* Light blue Python versions are currently supported.
* Dark blue Python versions are upcoming Python releases for which support is expected in the future.

Some extra remarks:

* The length of the Python version boxes is indicative of the support duration according to the `SPEC-0`_ policy.
* The color of the Python version boxes is indicative of the PyAnsys metapackage current support.
